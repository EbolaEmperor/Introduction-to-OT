Let's begin with the first OT problem: the sand-moving problem. A child wants to make a pile of sand in the shape of a castle. He consumes 1 kilocalorie of energy for every meter he moves a shovel of sand in the horizontal direction. How can we minimize the total energy he consumes?

Here is a mathematical formulation. Let's denote the source shape by $f(x)$ and the target by $g(x)$. Then we need to find a **transport mapping** $T$ to minimize the equation $(1)$. And the mapping should satisfy the equation $(2)$.

Here's another OT problem: the allocation problem, which is a discrete problem.

There are some steel coils to be transported from warehouses to factories. The transport cost is $1 per coil and per kilometer. How to minimize the total cost?

Let's assume the $i$-th warehouse has $a_i$ coils and the $j$-th factory needs $b_i$ coils. And assume the distance between the $i$-th warehouse and the $j$-th factory is $d_{ij}$. The formulation is: find a **transport matrix** $v_{ij}$ to minimize the equation $(3)$. And the matrix should satisfy the equation $(4)$.
